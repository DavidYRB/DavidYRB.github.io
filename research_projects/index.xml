      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snake robots offer a useful and unique mobility platform for search-and-rescue applications. However, existing prototypes made of rigid links and joints are hampered by a lack of flexibility that limits their utility in highly cluttered, maze-like environments, and their heavy weight limits their energy-efficiency and performance in three-dimensional (3-D) tasks. As an application based on the research of origami modular manipulator, we created an OriSnake to perform two types (undulation and sidewinding) locomotion that are common seen from real snakes. The OriSnake is assembled by four cylindrical, origami continuum modules driven by internal cables and electric motors, as well as a local feedback control system on each module. Thus, we can distribute actuation, sensing, and control for highly scalable soft robotic continuum origami systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-contribution&#34;&gt;Main Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contribution of this work mainly related to the WPI OriSnake including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a Origami Snake robot that is capable of both lateral undulation and side-winding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyzing the behavior of the OriSnake under different
locomotion parameters and search for optimal set of parameters
for maximum linear speed for both locomotion gaits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuum manipulators, robot limbs inspired by trunks, snakes, and tentacles, represent a promising field in robotic manipulation research. They are well known for their compliance, as they can conform to the shape of objects they interact with. Furthermore, they also benefit from dexterity and reduced weight compared to traditional rigid manipulators. This research aims to create and evaluate an origami-inspired cable driven continuum manipulator module that offers low-cost, low volume deployment, light weight, and inherently safe human interaction and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;main-contribution&#34;&gt;Main Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the contribution of this work is the development and analysis of a new approach to continuum
manipulation that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses an origami-inspired mechanism as its body, allowing for significant extension/contraction and bending
motions;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Has a high torsional strength, allowing it to resist
undesired twisting deformations in 3-D space;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is composed of self-contained modules, whereby the
addition of modules requires minimal design changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
